<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to create a hostel recommendation engine using hostel details, user information, and user reviews from hostelworld. Hostelworld is the leading online reservation site for budget travelers. During my travels around the globe in recent years, I have used Hostelworld almost exclusively, and owe many wonderful memories and friendships to it. In my experience the hostels I have found through Hostelworld’s reviews were always wonderful, and the information Hostelworld supplied on them was reliable. However, travelers don’t always have the time to research enough hostels before making a decision, and this can lead to travelers ending up in hostels that are not the right fit for them. This is the reason I want to build a recommendation engine that takes into account review text and hostel descriptions.   </p>

<p>Hostelworld lets users search for lodging given location, dates, and number of guests. It also lets users apply filters to their search. Because hostels are budget lodging and cater to a very specific demographic, most have similar prices and features. Therefore applying filters to a search can help narrow down the options, but isn’t enough to tell which hostel is right for the user. Even with filters applied to a search the users must read the hostel descriptions and reviews to get a good idea for which hostel is the best match for them.  </p>

<a id="collecting-data" class="anchor" href="#collecting-data" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collecting Data</h3>

<p>To collect user information and reviews I randomly generated codes to insert into a 
profile/reviews link. I tested which codes belonged to users, and which codes brought me to an error page. </p>

<p>I saved the codes that belonged to profiles where the users had left reviews, and used them to scrape user information and reviews. While scraping for reviews I collected links to the hostels being reviewed. Using those links I scraped hostel details, descriptions, policies, and features.
I collected information and reviews for 10,929 users. Those users left 21,675 reviews about 5,453 hostels.</p>

<a id="data-exploration" class="anchor" href="#data-exploration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Exploration</h3>

<p>My data was collected into three dataframes: users, reviews, and hostels. 
The users data showed that most of my users are from The United States. The most common travel group types were solo male, solo female, and in a couple. Most users did not specify an age group, but the users that did fell mostly into the 25-30 age group. Most users left fewer than 5 reviews. </p>

<p>The hostels’ data showed that the majority of my hostels are in Italy, Spain, and Australia. Most of the hostels have a rating between 8.5 and 9. </p>

<p>The reviews data showed that most of the reviews were for hostels in Italy, Spain, and England. January, December, July, and August were the months with the most reviews written. </p>

<a id="topic-modeling" class="anchor" href="#topic-modeling" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Topic Modeling</h3>

<p>Using countvectorizer with stopwords = english and ngram_range = (2,2) I found the most common phases in hostel descriptions to be “free wifi”, “cancellation Policy”, and “24 hours”.</p>

<p>Using an lda model and a list of stopwords found through a process of trial and error, I created 10 topics for hostel descriptions. For every hostel description I found the probability that it might contain each topic. A histogram of every hostel description’s max topic probability showed that most of the reviews had a high probability in one topic instead of having a low probability in several.</p>

<p>Using a similar process on review text I found the most common phrase in the reviews to be “customer comment”. Customer comment is the text left in a review when a user chose not to write anything. The next most common phrases are “place stay”, “great location”, and “staff friendly”. </p>

<p>Similar to the hostel descriptions I created 10 review topics and for every review found the probability that it might contain each topic. A histogram of the max topic probabilities for each review showed that reviews, unlike the hostel descriptions, do not have probabilities in one topic. They have lower probabilities in several topics. </p>

<a id="jaccard-distance" class="anchor" href="#jaccard-distance" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jaccard Distance</h3>

<p>I created a distance function for hostels and users using jaccard distance. Jaccard distance is found by dividing the length of elements two sets have in common by the length of total elements in the two sets. Jaccard distance is between zero and one with one being a perfect match.</p>

<p>For every user I created a set with their age group, travel group types, number of hostels they’ve stayed at, list of hostels they’ve rated highly, list of countries they’ve stayed at, mean score of reviews, and topics in which their reviews have had high probabilities.</p>

<p>For every hostel I created a set with its rating, location, number of awards, free and general amenities, services, entertainment,  food and drink facilities, policies, and any topics in which the description had a high probability. </p>

<h3>
<a id="hostel-recommendation" class="anchor" href="#hostel-recommendation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hostel Recommendation</h3>

<p>Using the two distance functions I created a function that recommends hostels for a given user. The function first finds the closest users (Best-Match-Users) to the given user (UserA). It then takes the list of hostels User-A has rated highly, and compares them to the list of hostels the Best-Match-Users have rated highly. For every hostel in UserA’s list it returns the closest hostel in the Best-Match-Users’ list and the link to that hostel.</p>

<a id="looking-forward" class="anchor" href="#looking-forward" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Looking Forward</h3>

<p>Currently I am working on creating a recommendation engine that uses ratings generated by taking the dot product of users and hostels instead of by using jaccard distance. With the data I have collected for this project I am working on creating more unique and interesting topics for both hostels and reviews. Using the probabilities of those topics as well as other information provided on Hostelworld I am rating hostels from -5 to 5 in the following categories: popularity, party atmosphere, tourism, city center, public transportation, adventure, communal atmosphere, safety, cleanliness, and wifi. A user can then give a location and rate how they feel about these categories, to receive hostel recommendations. </p>

<h3>
<a id="conclusion" class="anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Users don’t always look through enough reviews to find the rights ones. With this recommendation engine, they don’t have to. I don’t think there are any bad hostels per se; it’s just a matter of finding the right one. Also, many travelers face a time issue because they haven’t planned in advance and don’t have a data plan, so they will be searching quickly when they arrive in a city. With the recommendation engine, they’re not just picking a random hostel; they’re picking a hostel from a list that has been tailored to them. A product like this would improve a user’s experience at hostels, but also a hostel’s experience with its users.</p>
